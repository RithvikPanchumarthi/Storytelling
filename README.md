Importance of Data Visualization.

Data visualization is the process of transforming data into a visual format that can be easily understood by humans. This can be done through the use of charts, graphs, maps, and other visual representations. Data visualization can be used to tell stories about data, by highlighting trends, patterns, and relationships.

There are many different types of data visualizations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The most appropriate type of visualization for a particular story will depend on the data being used, the audience, and the purpose of the story.
